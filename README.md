# Bond-pricing-and-Interest-Rates-in-q
Implementation in KDB+/q of a series of functions of interest to bond pricing and interest rates modelling.

## Built with
The code was implemented in KDB+/q. For the plots I used embedded Python and Matplotlib.

## Requirements
- kdb+>= v3.5 64-bit
- Python >= 3.5
- [embedPy](https://github.com/KxSystems/embedPy)

## Acknowledgments
The present work contains implementations in KDB+/q of functions presented in the following books:
1) Hull J, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives, Pearson, 9th Edition, Harlow (UK), 2018 (chapter 4).
2) Weiming J M, Mastering Python for Finance, Packt Publishing, 1st Edition, Birmingham (UK), 2015 (chapter 5). 

The wrapper for matplotlib.pyplot in q was downloaded from the repository <https://github.com/KxSystems/jupyterq>.

In addition, I used a function for rounding provided by Kim Tang in <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/personal-kdbplus/VMduB32vz7I>.
